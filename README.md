# LINE in PyTorch

This repository contains a implementation of [LINE: Large-scale Information Network Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03578) in PyTorch. Currently, the implementation is very simple and inefficient â€“ it does not contain ~~negative~~/edge sampling.

## Resources
The code is based off of the original paper as well as numerous implementations
of LINE.
